Firstly, configure dvc remote either local or remotely(using dagyard) 

```
!dvc repro
```
Then run the command above to execute the data preprocessing and training experiment pipelines as found in this [notebook](https://github.com/Tob-iee/data-experiment_tracking/blob/main/Notebooks/run_train_script.ipynb) 

# Workflow Architecture

This is a high level architecture design of the data preprocessing and training experiment workflow
